# LendingClubCaseStudy
> Here we find that we are to assess the probability of default of credit before lending so that we may sanction the correct projects and reject those applications which have a high probability of default. Both cases(not sanctioning the right applications and sanctioning the wrong applications) may lead to revenue loss.
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
